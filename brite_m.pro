;- Constants are from "The Fundamental Physical Constants",
;- Cohen, E. R. and B. N. Taylor, Physics Today, August 1993.

;- Planck constant (Joule second)
h = 6.6260755e-34

;- Speed of light in vacuum (meters per second)
c = 2.9979246e+8

;- Boltzmann constant (Joules per Kelvin)
k = 1.380658e-23

;- Derived constants
c1 = 2.0 * h * c * c
c2 = (h * c) / k

;- Convert wavenumber to inverse meters
vs = 1.0e+2 * v

;- Compute brightness temperature
return, c2 * vs / alog(c1 * vs^3 / (1.0e-5 * r) + 1.0)
